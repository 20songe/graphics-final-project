## Visual Goal: 
Real-time rendering of a landscape, featuring water, grass and a tree with falling leaves.


### Tree Implementation methodology:


### Water Implementation Methodology:
1. refraction texture: everything under the water

2. reflection texture: everything above the water

3. du/dv map: distort both the refraction and reflection texture, will change over time to give the impression of rippling

4. Fresnel effect: how much each texture will contribute to the final result 

5.  Lighting: normal map, so the water doesn't look flat (what will be our light source? A sun?) 

6. Depth: depth texture
